  What is this?
  ------------

This javadoc doclet that generates an RDF representation of javadocs.


  How do I use it?
  ---------------

First, you need ant installed. [Get it from http://ant.apache.org if 
you don't have it installed.]

Second, run "ant" where the build.xml file is located (alongside this very 
document). This will generate a jar file called "rdf_doclet.jar" and then
use it as a doclet to generate an RDF javadoc of the doclet source code in
the './javadoc' folder.

Look into the build.xml file on how to use the doclet on your own ant
build scripts.
